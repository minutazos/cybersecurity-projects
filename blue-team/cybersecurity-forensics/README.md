# Cybersecurity Forensics Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity Forensics Projects Repository**.

This repository contains forensic analyses conducted as part of an academic project at **Epitech**, where we played the role of cybersecurity forensics investigators.

The projects involve tackling challenges from *[HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/)* and subsequently documenting our findings in forensic reports.


## Project description

Each project within this repository corresponds to a distinct challenge sourced from HackTheBox. Within each folder, you will discover pertinent information about the corresponding HackTheBox challenge, accompanied by a concise overview of the analysis conducted and its findings. For a more in-depth exploration, please refer to the attached Forensics Report. Additionally, you will find the files subjected to analysis in each respective folder.
