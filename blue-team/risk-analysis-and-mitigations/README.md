# Risk Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Risk Analysis project repository, a part of the academic curriculum at Epitech. In this project, we assume the role of risk analysts for the company FakeCorp SA. FakeCorp has engaged our services to assess and mitigate potential risks associated with its architecture and implementations. This repository contains a comprehensive list of identified risks, their respective impacts, and proposed mitigations. Additionally, a detailed summary of the mitigations is provided in a PDF document for further reference.

## Project Scope

### Company Overview

FakeCorp SA is a development company located in Paris, operating within a private office space. The office features an open space for employees, a separate room for the director, and controlled access through badges. The office is rented and maintained by a building service that includes basic cleaning. Notably, there are no locks inside the office.

The company employs five stationary workers, all using Windows 10 desktops with restricted software installation permissions. One of them, designated as the admin, handles critical data. The computers have USB ports, are equipped with basic Windows antivirus, and lack data protection measures. Customer data is received via USB, and communication is primarily conducted through GIT and shared folders. External IT oversight, an ISO 27001-certified company, handles computer maintenance.

### IT Infrastructure Overview

#### Computers and Software
- The computers run Windows 10, and only the admin can install software.
- Top-of-the-shelf software is used but lacks regular updates.
- Communication occurs via email and Slack.

#### Network
- Infrastructure is connected via wired connections and a switch.
- A WiFi AP is connected to the switch for phones and tablets, with an unprotected WiFi network.
- The ISP choice needs justification.
- Git repository is hosted on the main server.
- Server runs Windows Server 2019 OS, with monthly backups and shared folders.

#### Security Measures
- No protection on WiFi, posing a risk to the network.
- Lack of regular software updates.
- Basic Windows Server 2019 OS on the server.
- Unsecured printer on the same network.
- Server accessed via Microsoft accounts without multi-factor authentication.
