# Cloud Architecture

## Overview

Welcome to the Cloud Architecture project repository, an academic initiative undertaken at Epitech. In this project, we assume the role of cloud architects tasked with the responsibility of migrating the existing on-premise infrastructure of the company FakeCloud to the cloud securely. This migration is essential as FakeCloud aims to expand its service offerings.

## Project Scope

The primary objective is to design and implement a secure cloud architecture that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of FakeCloud's services. This repository encompasses comprehensive documentation detailing the architecture, including schematics, technical specifications, implementation planning, and pricing considerations.

## Executive Summary

FakeCorp SA is a development company that provides customers with infrastructures and simple web applications.

They are currently using:
- An accounting software.
- A Customer Relationship Management software.

We know for sure that both are compatible with the IAM caution of the chosen cloud provider.

They organically developed until they hit 5 customers and now want to move from an on-premise environment to a full cloud infrastructure.

Their customers are mostly in Europe but one of them is in the USA.

In this context, this document contains a presentation of what will be the new full cloud architecture for this project.

## Contents

### 1. Cloud Architecture Documentation
   - **Schematics:** Visual representations of the proposed cloud architecture.
   - **Technical Specifications:** In-depth details about the chosen technologies and configurations.
   - **Implementation Planning:** A step-by-step plan outlining the deployment process.
   - **Pricing:** Considerations and estimates related to the cost of the proposed cloud infrastructure.

### 2. Files
   - A directory containing all necessary configuration files written in Terraform for deploying the infrastructure.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the documentation and configuration files provided in this repository to gain insights into the secure cloud architecture designed for FakeCloud.
