# Cybersecurity Projects Repository

Welcome to my cybersecurity projects repository! This collection showcases projects developed in an academic or personal context to enhance my skills in the field of cybersecurity. The repository is organized into two main categories: Blue Team and Red Team.

## Blue Team Projects

### Cloud Architecture
Explore the [Cloud Architecture](./blue_team/cloud-architecture) project, an academic initiative conducted at Epitech. In this project, we act as cloud architects tasked with securely migrating the on-premise infrastructure of FakeCloud to the cloud. The goal is to facilitate the expansion of FakeCloud's service offerings.

### Cybersecurity Forensics
Visit the [Cybersecurity Forensics](./blue_team/cybersecurity-forensics) project repository, which contains forensic analyses conducted as part of an academic project at Epitech. In this endeavor, we step into the role of cybersecurity forensics investigators, examining digital evidence to uncover security incidents.

### Risk Analysis
Discover the [Risk Analysis](./blue_team/risk-analysis-and-mitigations) project repository, a vital component of the academic curriculum at Epitech. In this project, we serve as risk analysts for FakeCorp SA, conducting assessments and proposing mitigations for potential risks associated with the company's architecture and implementations. The repository includes a comprehensive list of identified risks, their impacts, and proposed mitigations, along with a detailed summary in a PDF document for reference.

## Red Team Projects
Here you will find different offensive HTB challenges, the write-ups may be simple and plain text or more descriptive and in pdf format.


Feel free to explore the projects, and thank you for visiting!
